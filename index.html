         <h3>current situation</h3>
         <p style="color:white;font-size: medium; margin-top: 1cm;line-height: 29px;">Enes Robinson is a passionate young man from an
             African country who has big dreams. Unfortunately, 
             his country doesn't support his aspirations, and he faces numerous hardships in his pursuit of a better life. Despite these challenges, Enes remains determined to succeed, and his story is an inspiration to anyone who has faced adversity in their own lives.

            Growing up, Enes faced many obstacles. His family had 
            a lack of resources, and his country's education system
             was of low quality. Despite these challenges, Enes 
             remained committed to his dream of pursuing a better 
            life through education. He knew that he needed to
            leave his country to achieve his goals, so he decided 
            to study abroad.
            
            However, his journey was far from easy. Enes faced financial challenges, and he couldn't afford the rent and monthly expenses required to support himself in his new country. He was lost between following his dream or continuing his studies, but he knew that he couldn't give up. He decided to return home to face the challenges head-on, knowing that the journey would be dangerous and that he might not make it back alive.</p>
